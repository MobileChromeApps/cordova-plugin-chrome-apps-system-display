# chrome.system.display Plugin

This plugin provides the ability to query display metadata.

## Status

Alpha quality on Android and iOS.

## Caveats

### Android

`chrome.system.display.getInfo` is the only method to be implemented for now.
Please be aware that `mirroringSourceId`, `isInternal` and `isEnabled` cannot
be retrieved.

### iOS

`chrome.system.display.getInfo` is the only method currently implemented:
* The properties `dpiX` and `dpiY` are approximations
* The properties `mirroringSourceId`, `isInternal` and `isEnabled` are not 
implemented.
